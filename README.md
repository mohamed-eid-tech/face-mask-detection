# 😷 Face Mask Detection  

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to automatically detect whether individuals in images are **wearing a face mask** or **not wearing a face mask**.  

Developed as part of the **Machine Learning Training Program** at the **National Telecommunication Institute (NTI)**, the project aims to support **public health and safety efforts** through AI-powered automation.

## 🧠 Model  
The deep learning model leverages **CNNs** to:  
- Extract relevant facial features from input images.  
- Classify them into two categories:  
  - ✅ With Mask  
  - ❌ Without Mask
